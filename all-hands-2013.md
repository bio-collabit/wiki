# All Hands Meeting 2013

## About 

* Location: SESYNC, Annapolis MD
* Dates: Sept 26-27, 2013

## Purpose 

The purpose of this two-day workshop is to bring together the technical and operational staff of the various synthesis centers to identify specific projects that can be used to bootstrap further inter-center collaboration.

At a high level, all of synthesis centers focus on facilitating collaborative science. Over the years, some common services have been created at each center around collaboration infrastructure as well as assessment measuring and reporting, education/technical literacy, and custom development of research services.  However the tools, technologies and policies that have been implemented to fulfill these needs in the context of each center's mission vary widely. By bringing together the technical staffs of the various centers we hope to develop a set of best practices and identify technical or administrative resources that can be shared across centers.

At the end of the workshop we will have identified 2-3 low hanging fruit projects and developed an implementation plan for each. Following a workshop, a report will be generated detailing the needs identified, implementation plans for the identified projects and a list of larger collaborative projects which could be proposed for future work.
