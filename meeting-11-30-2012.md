## Meeting Minutes 
**Represented Organizations**

- iDigBio
- NESCent
- NCEAS
- SESYNC
- NIMBios
- iPlant

**Identified Challenges/Center Overview**

* SESYNC
  * New center, identify tools in use and upcoming tools for the community
  * Resource allocation, every group wants a developer/postdoc

* Nimbios
  * web casting and recording including conferencing and conference recording
  * How do you rapidly get groups up to speed in collaborative environments
  * Ensuring proper training and buy-in for various tools.
  * Rapid turnover in tools

* iPlant
  * Collaborative environment consists of webex, confluence open atrium, basecamp
  * No desire to be prescriptive in forcing groups to use any one particular environment
  * Groups wishing to use in-house research tools require a long startup, often requires customization on a per group basis
  * Groups will use tools because there is nothing better

* NCEAS
  * technical proficiency of wg's vary widely
  * Desire to promote data and tool sharing

* NESCent
  * Similar problems of tool idendification and training
  * They anticipate issues surrounding their sunsetting in two years. EOL of developed resources, how to sustain developed resources, 

* iDigBio
  * New center, 1.5 yrs in
  * Charged w/ creating a national collection, large scale digitization effort.
  * Concerns with scaling, sustainability
  * Software stack similar to SESYNC, Drupal for collaboration groups, Adobe Connect, redmine, basic wiki support

**Examples of collaboration**

* NEAD/Administrative database. NCEAS developed, NESCent reimplemented/improved, NCEAS used NESCent's improved version. NIMBios and SESYNC are using NEAD as a reference platform for their own DB's. Local Institutional policy may prevent a common system, but can we collect common metrics.

* Most centers have groups that exist at multiple sites (sesync/nceas, 

* What about high-end telepresense between centers. As flights/moving people costs go up, how can we better serve remote participants.

**Possible Collaboration areas, identied issues**
* Can we identify a cross center identity for researchers to allow for publication tracking, data sharing? Does that involve authentication?
* wiki burnout, wiki per working group leads to many dead, minimally used wiki's. 
* What ways can we integrate out collaboration environments, sharing knowledge, training
* Would the stack-overflow model be better for training, knowledge transfer
* How can we share institutional knowledge across centers
* Can we standardize out metrics reporting? Nimbios forwarded Pam Bishop's writup (see mailing list) 

**Logistics**
* 2pm, first Friday of the month will be the regular meeting time. 
* We will use a different telecon stack each time (webex for 1/4 meeting)
