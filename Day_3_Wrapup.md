# Day 3 Wrapup

## What worked well and what could be improved 

See also additional [discussion notes from wrap-up](http://piratepad.net/collabsci-fri-wrapup.html)

**What worked well?**

* unconference day
* learning what others are doing
* starting with the mind map as a way of getting ideas on the table
* critical mass of social scientists
* learning about how one group (e.g. social sci.) percieves the work of another (e.g. biology)
* everyone is in the same boat
* minimal "death by powerpoint"
* facilitation and report-outs rotated
* single sentence intros

**What to do differently?**

* narrower topics
* allow more people to present (short length)
* disentangle the dimensions of CI
* more pre-workshop coordination among domain scientists
* make report-outs more interactive
* time to plan each track at the time rather than in the morning
* compartmentalize areas of CI so that attention can be given to areas that were missing here (HPC, models, etc)
* invite skeptics
* focus on cross-domain questions and CI needs that span centers
* cross-center call for workshops?
* centers - swap personnel?
* show and tell of systems
* presentations from domain scientists
* community help desk for collaboration
* send materials ahead of time for review (people profiles)
* knowing at the time of invitation who is invited

## Ideas beyond 

* helpdesk for center collaboration; accumulate pain and success stories about various needs and tools
* informatics staff swap
