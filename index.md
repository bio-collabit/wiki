# 2011 Cyberinfrastructure for Collaborative Science Workshop 

This workshop was funded by NSF and held May 18-20, 2011, at the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) in Durham, North Carolina. The workshop brought together a diverse group of informatics practitioners, social scientists, technology experts, and biologists with different perspectives and experiences on enabling multi-disciplinary research collaborations that often rely heavily on informatics to succeed.  The event aimed for new targets for better coordination to emerge, and to forge new collaborations into how cyberinfrastructure can enable scientific culture change.
