# 2011 Cyberinfrastructure for Collaborative Science Workshop 

This workshop was funded by NSF and held May 18-20, 2011, at the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) in Durham, North Carolina. The workshop brought together a diverse group of informatics practitioners, social scientists, technology experts, and biologists with different perspectives and experiences on enabling multi-disciplinary research collaborations that often rely heavily on informatics to succeed.  The event aimed for new targets for better coordination to emerge, and to forge new collaborations into how cyberinfrastructure can enable scientific culture change.

The [Workshop Homepage](2011_Workshop.html) provides the best starting point to learn more about the objectives and ideas going into the event, and the various documents and other products resulting from it.

This wiki
=========

This wiki is itself a product of the 2011 Workshop. It started as the workshop wiki, and [was at the end designated](2011_Workshop/Day_3_Breakouts#Action_plan.html) to become a wiki for documentation of experiences with and technologies for cyberinfrastructure development for enabling science collaborations, especially in the participating synthesis centers. Since this meeting, the NSF provided funding for continued collaboration between the various Bio centers including monthly conference calls and yearly meetings. 

We welcome everyone's contributions to adding and maintaining content. All content of the wiki is public. Editing requires logging in with an account, but anyone can create an account through OpenID - use the "Login with OpenID" link at the top.

Mailing list
=============

The National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis(NIMBioS) hosts a mailing list which is used for discussion between the various centers and any interested parties. Please use the link below to subscribe.
