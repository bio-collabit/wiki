## Purpose 

The purpose of this two-day workshop is to build on [last year's](all-hands-2013.html) all hands meeting by continuing work on a few of the topics identified last year while identifying new areas of collaboration and common problems.

## Topics 

This is the preliminary list of topics for the October meeting, please feel free to suggest new topics or recommend changes.

1. Center check-in. What has changed at your site in the past 12mo, What are your new collaborations? Are you searching for new collaborators?
2. Data literacy coordination across our centers. By the time this meeting occurs, there will have been 4 'Data Carpentry' workshops at the various centers and a number of other education efforts at different centers. What worked, what didn't? What are the next steps?
3. Software standards across the centers. What would we like to see promoted as best practice for research development? How can we promote that amongst our communities.
4. Resource Aggregation. The biocenters.org domain was purchased last year to aggregate information from across the various centers. Is there a desire to have a shared institutional memory? Is this the right mechanism? 
5. Central Repositories for Protocols / Workflows / Powerpoints...
6. Open Topics, facilitated identification of new collaboration projects.
