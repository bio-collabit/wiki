# 2011 Workshop/Day 3 Breakouts
## Strategic directions for synthesis centers 

(also see [origional notes on PiratePad](http://piratepad.net/collabsci-fri-strategic-directions) )

Two key questions:
 1. What kind of infrastructure research to fund, what questions should be asked? 
 2. Who needs to be involved, what structure is needed to sustain its outcomes?

CI supports more than collaboration; also supports shared resources. What groups depend on what resources from other groups?

What is the landscape of the fields (such as resources for data, methods, etc) groups of people that want to collaborate?

CI has different levels of granularity; everyone has a different concepts of this; similar to level of analysis in research. Can we define these levels:

* low level: sharing data
* higher level: interoperable data / tools

Dichotomy between people who want to share (use) data and those that don't want to share (their) data. What part of system benefits the collectors? How do we get to a critical mass of people sharing data?

* A DataONE postdoc is researching incentives to and benefits of data sharing. 
* embedding provenance in data can benefit individual scientists (searching, reusing their own data)

Two meanings of sharing data

* just making raw data available
* making additional information / social context available (i.e. access to the scientist, the underlying research); facilitating discussion about data; one example is MyPlant.org (and iPlant social network for plant biologists)

CI provides ability to have access to data or methods without developing a new collaboration, or using intergrads to collect from literature; access to larger body of knowledge

* Challenge with legacy data (data that is not archived in repositories). "Career sets", data accumulated by a senior scientists over their career lifetime. Many times current research is not reproducing the same data points, so the only way to obtain them from (for synthesis) is legacy data.

What is the role of the synthesis centers? Supporting individual scientists / groups? Developing domain-specific resources? Looking broadly across domains?

* Synthesis centers seem to be in a unique position to look for patterns and similarities across domains (across centers).
* The products of broader aimed CI initiatives often overlap surprisingly little with the gaps faced by scientists supported at the centers.
* There is a need for stewardship role for community resources (example: TreeBASE) that should expand among the centers.
* Also an education role (increasing community capacity), for resident scientists, for broader community through hackathons and courses

Are synthesis centers the right place to do this?

* short-term funding; how does that relate to long-term projects and stewardship
* Data Conservancy plays this role (also DataONE); will these become permanant organizations?
* institutions that host DC will not go away, exploring models for permanancy; expanding existing role of libraries
* synthesis centers can fill this gap between initial funding and permanent home for repositories; perhaps institutional repositories can also fill this gap

Role of broader initiatives that go beyond boundaries for synthesis centers

* DataONE
* government initiatives to coordinate national labs
* national efforts for veterens hospitals (huge effort; thousands of programmers)
* Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) across earth sciences is a great example, connected to DAACs (Digital Active Archive Centers)
* SONet (Scientific Observation Network); aim is to bring people who work on observational data together; find common level of abstraction across disciplines

Common problem: extracting knowledge from natural language text

Medium-term support 

* after initial grant is over and before long-term sustainability
* need maintenance, support, minimal development
* treebase, vegnet are examples; still a used resource but no direct funding

Four key roles for CI

  1. preserve data (and other stuff - workflows, tools, etc.)
  2. share community resources / tools
  3. connect people with people, people with resources and resources with resources
  4. support scientitic process, and specifically the collaborative and integrative science process

NSF: What is your road map for short-term? This all sounds like "We are working on it". How do we connect this discussion to the discussion in the other room about what is currently happening in synthesis centers?

Consider an agile perspective on how to make all this happen: you likely won't do something well before you've taken some iterations.

**Notes from discussion during report-out:**

* There is not necessarily a hard line between tools for collaborative science and tools for individuals - in fact in many cases tools that are useful to the individual subsequently enable or foster collaboration.
* Centers have to concern themselves with how to preserve or archive the various artefacts from their science, such as MediaWiki or Plone sites

## Cross-center IT coordination 

### **What we hope to get**

* Identify expertise to help solve local problems 
* Evaluate new tech 
* Identify shared problems to ask for new funding 
* Cross-training funding opportunities 
* Mechanism for coordinating teaching goals to working groups, also teaching materials (slides, videos,â€¦) 
* Annual face to face meeting of IT staff from different centers

### **Action plan**

* Monthly virtual brown bag lunch: describe targeted audience for each (i.e., sysadmins for wikis). Have talks about how a certain technology was chosen, what is coming down the road from DataOne, intro to a new technology, etc. Try different technologies to experiment (via EVO one meeting, via Adobe Connect another): Shaun Walbridge, NCEAS 
  * First meeting topic is what each center does (then put this on the IT wiki)<br> 
  * Other potential meeting topics<br> 
    * Open source licensing 
    * Licensing of data 
	* Licensing of commercial software (i.e., buying software) 
    * Common user training 
    * How to bootstrap a new synthesis center: Mike Smourl, EnSync 
      * List of what you need to start a center (white paper?) 
      * Maybe even a virtual image or a set of installers 
    * User authentication -- cross center? even different systems within centers 
    * Data and metadata management 
    * Dealing with infrastructure of servers (cloud, VM, standard) 
    * NEAD and similar visitor hosting infrastructure 
    * Suggestions for best practices<br>
* [Mailing list of people](2011 Workshop/Links#Cross-center Collaborative Science IT Support mailing list.html)(allow opt in): Eric Carr, NIMBioS *Done.* 
* [Center IT Wiki](Main Page.html): use collab sci wiki currently hosted at NESCent. Use OpenID. Vladimir Gapeyev, NESCent *Done.*
* Open iPlant tech meetings (intros to technologies) to the group. Same for other centers: Eric Lyons, iPlant; others as they come up 
* Outreach to BEACON (NSF), also Canadian Center for Ecology, other groups with significant overlap to get them involved once the meetings start going

### **NSF support for coordination (even supplemental grants)**

*Travel grants: mini sabbaticals for training 
*Technology with high cost of entry

### **Report-out Discussion**

* How does all this all of this relate to the DataONE effort?
* Should we bring together all relevant CI projects (CI projects that the centers are involved with)?
  * All of these are open to or even looking for participation.
  * ACTION: Should capture / reveal all of our CI project identities.
* The IT staff at the centers is largely implementing the stated mission, and the direction set by the center directors.
* There is a need for guidance as to which technologies in supporting collaboration are potentially more beneficial or detrimental to the social dynamics of a group.
  * The social science questions in this are as complex as technical ones for considering technical alternatives, and they are strongly context dependent.
  * [Collaboration Success Wizard](http://hana.ics.uci.edu/wizard) : what factors can predict the success of scientific collaboration? Diagnostic tool on what makes a good collaboration, also results in guidance.
* Breakdown of IT staff at the centers: what are the strategies, directions, and issues commonly encountered?
  * Teaching materials for low-level technical tools or system
  * Put the focus on what the domain scientists are doing and need on the ground.
  * Perhaps this needs to happen separately from the technical coordination activities, to allow enough time and focus on this.
  * Exchange and coordination of training.
  * ACTION: Karen Cranston will be point.
