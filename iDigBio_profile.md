# IDigBio

## IT/Mission

Please provide an overview of the scope of support, and to whom you provide it.

**Who do you serve?**

* Bio-researchers, educators, government agencies, policy makers, businesses, citizen scientists, general public

**What services do you provide?**

* Digitization training, access to biodiversity collections data, virtual machines for temporary storage and databasing

## Center Overview

Please provide a high level overview of the services your center provides, who you serve, and the overall environment in which your center operates. Please consider the following items

**Please give a brief overview of your center’s CI offerings, both hardware, software, programming and consultative services**

* Hardware: virtual machines for partners and collaborators
* Software/Web: portal and website, Drupal environments to partners in our cloud VMs

** What percentage of your researchers utilize your provided resources?** 

* unknown

** What new capabilities are you planning to introduce in the next 12-18 months?**

* Web presence (website and portal) improvements, after usability testing
* Services to new partners, as they are awarded funding

**What resources (computational/storage/personal/other) do you need that would assist you/your center?**

* Data storage
* CRM software
* Marketing / technical writing
* Possible usability testing candidates

**What externally supported resources do your researchers/staff rely on?**

* Email
* Adobe Connect
* Redmine/Drupal/MediaWiki

**What resources would you like to rely on from other centers?** 

* Unknown

**What evaluation mechanisms/procedures do you have in place to evaluate your center's deployed resources with what your community requires?**

* Periodic surveys, per event
* Internal metrics

**What needs analysis procedures do you have in place to evaluate the resources required by your customers/researchers?**

* Audience definition document

## Communications

Please describe the communications capability of your center, and the communication mechanisms in use by your researchers. If possible, please provide approximate percentage of center researchers/staff which use or are impacted by specific technologies.

**What other communications mechanisms do you provide to your researchers?**

* Email
* Adobe Connect
* Wiki
* Web Forum
* Percentages unknown

**What external mechanisms do your researchers use to collaborate/communicate?**

* See above

**What software do you currently use to support video/tele-conferencing?**

* Adobe Connect
* Occasionally Skype

**What is your scaling capacity for in-center meetings (# rooms, #participants), do you have specialized hardware/software to support conferencing in these rooms?**

* 2 rooms (35 capacity with spillover), with mics, projectors, and webcam
* University has resources for larger groups

**How many remote participants are you able to support (both interactively and webinar/broadcast)**

* Adobe Connect can support unlimited users, broadcast max ~1000s
* but interactive ~20 depending on users’ bandwidth

**What new teleconferencing / collaboration requirements or features have you identified that are not met by your current conference offerings?**

* We routinely increase the number of Adobe Connect hosts, as it becomes more effective.

**What difficulties do you currently encounter with on-site and/or remote participants?**

* Different people have different volume issues, and because of room constraints, sometimes people are not able to be heard.
* Meeting quality is dependent on the lowest common denominator for bandwidth and audio.
* People still have trouble getting their connections to work unless we are sure to log into a meeting early to do sound checks.
* Even though Adobe Connect is easy to use, we still have trouble after 2 years of practice.


## Data Management
**Please describe any storage resources you provide for your research groups / postdocs? Including type of storage (object/posix/etc), amount, and how it is accessed.**

* We provide temporary storage to specific partners
* We provide our specimen collections data via Riak and Swift with ElasticSearch.

**Please describe where you deposit data for long term preservation and what types of process are required for deposit**

* We have a complex cloud-based cyberinfrastructure that requires authentication and authorization to use. When the data are in our preferred format, ingestion occurs. Otherwise we provide assistance to get the data into the right format.
* We have contracted with the university for backup services, and redundancy with one of our partners.

**Please describe any external data sharing your center or its researchers participates in. Do they use e-mail, use dropbox, iRods, gdocs, S3, etc?**

* We rely heavily on email, googledocs and dropbox. We have sharing available via idigbio.org

**What are the characteristics of the source data you deal with? Format, size, count, sources.**

* Bio-collections (museum specimens) using Darwin Core metadata and images with Audubon Core metadata. Estimated 1 billion specimens in the US from 1600+ institutions.

**What are the characteristics of the data products you/your researchers generate?**

* See above – we are a read-only repository, we make no changes. We provide a mechanism for specimen annotations.


## Researcher/User Description

We’d like to get a feel for how similar or different the researchers/center visitors are between each of us. Could you provide a description of your community, its skills and needs. 

**What type of analysis does your community primarily do? Modeling, gis, database development, statistical analysis, etc**

* We don’t do analysis, but we facilitate research use of our repository and do education and outreach

**How technically proficient is your community (programming skill, modeling/scripting ability R,,Matlab, Excel,etc)**

* Depends on the precise definition/scope of the audience – from expert to novice.

**What tools does your user community use, and where do they access (in center, home organization, 3rd party**

* Web browser, genbank, Morphank, collections management databases (e.g., EMu, Specify, Symbiota, Arctos), Python, JavsScript, Perl

**What resource requests do you most often turn down?**

* For long-term archival storage of images
* Funding
* Software development

**If you host working groups, what technical resources do your groups use to facilitate collaboration? How comfortable are they in cross-disciplinary collaboration?**

* Adobe Connect, email, googledocs, Wiki
* They wrote the book on cross-disciplinary collaboration!

**On average, how much support are you able to provide your researchers in terms of programmer time, consultation, etc.?**

* As one of our primary missions, as much as they need, limited by our staff resources

**How comfortable are your users with collaborative, sharing technologies (data and document)?**

* Extremely comfortable, no barriers.
