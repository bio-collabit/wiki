# Cyberinfrastructure for Collaborative Science
## An NSF-funded workshop sponsored by and hosted at NESCent, May 18-20, 2011
### Synopsis 

This workshop brings together participants with a diverse set of perspectives, background, and experiences on enabling multi-disciplinary research collaborations that often rely heavily on informatics to succeed.  These include informatics practitioners, social scientists, technology experts, and biologists.  The workshop provides an opportunity for these groups to meet and exchange their experiences and challenges in designing and using cyberinfrastructure to enable research collaborations. The event is designed to facilitate the emergence of new targets for better coordination, and to forge new collaborations into how cyberinfrastructure can enable scientific culture change.

### Overview 

Science centers invariably encounter similar technical and sociological challenges in their support of diverse, heterogeneous, multi-disciplinary research collaborations. The needs are wide-ranging, from generic technologies for aggregating and visualizing data, to non-expert access to high-performance computing, to effective collaboration technologies.  Although many centers are devising creative and effective solutions to these challenges, they are largely doing so in isolation.  Furthermore, despite a sizable body of research into the socio-technical factors influencing technology adoption, in practice, the success with promoting interoperability standards and deploying domain-agnostic cyberinfrastructure is still mixed.  This workshop aims to promote the sharing of knowledge among centers, social scientists, and technology innovators, to increase cultivation of best practices, and to facilitate the development of coordinated solutions for informatics needs that are common among the research collaborations supported by the centers. 

The participants comprise a diverse group of people involved in various roles in enabling collaborative science. The group includes informatics staff from a cross-section of international science centers that support multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional, research collaborations; social scientists who are experts in obstacles to effective collaboration, data sharing, technology adoption, and the culture of science; biologists engaged in collaborative, cyberinfrastructure-dependent science; and technology innovators from the public and private sector who develop solutions for broad audiences.

The workshop program is organized in three primary components: 1) Experiences and challenges with developing and deploying CI for integration and analysis of heterogeneous data, one of the most commonly encountered informatics tasks in multi-disciplinary research collaborations; 2) Socio-technical aspects of CI success stories, challenges, and sustainability; and 3) Emerging opportunities for coordination of technology development and socio-technical research. These components interact throughout the event, and the program allows ample time for brainstorming and informal exchange among the diverse group of participants, so that new collaborations and targets for coordination can emerge.

### Program Components

#### Data cleaning, integration, and analysis 

One of the most common tasks faced by the kind of research collaborations supported at the centers is integrating data of heterogeneous kinds, sources, and quality, so that they can be analyzed as a whole. Such data is often culled from the literature, difficult to acquire in digital form, comes in a wide variety of formats, uses incompatible terminologies, and can be fraught with common inconsistencies such as spelling, naming, etc.  Analyses often consist of multi-step pipelines in which the arrangement and parameters of methods are highly customized, difficult to document, and can require significant computing resources. Which technologies have been deployed or promoted at the centers to alleviate such issues, and what lessons have resulted from supporting scientists, for example in terms of usability, effectiveness, required resources, and scalability? What experience has been made with leveraging domain-agnostic tools, commercial or academic? The main goal is to help make technology selection and deployment more effective by sharing the accumulated knowledge and experiences. A second goal is to identify gaps that represent common user needs unmet by current technology options. A third goal will be to identify ongoing technology research and development efforts that are attempting to address these issues for the life and earth sciences.

#### Socio-technical aspects of cyberinfrastructure

Much of the work of designing, implementing, and disseminating novel approaches, tools, and training programs to support new ways of doing science falls to the staffs of the science centers that sponsor novel collaborative research. How do staff members effectively catalyze and promote change -- if they indeed can? What are the pitfalls? What can be learned from previous studies of technology adoption, collaboration, and data sharing? Social scientists from fields as diverse as science and technology studies, history, human-computer interaction, organizational science, library and information science, and sociology are increasingly involved in science centers as a way to both bring insights from prior research to center activities and to study centers as a means to add to our knowledge. This program component has three goals. First, it will set the stage for discussion by presenting findings from social science research that illustrate the importance of the interaction between the social and the technical (i.e. socio- technical) in achieving goals related to technology adoption, data sharing, etc. Second, participants will identify common themes across centers, and third, they will explore  ways in which they can more effectively collaborate on new research or novel programs to address shared challenges or to aggregate lessons and findings across centers.

#### Developing coordination among centers 

The science centers participating in this workshop are all connected by a common mission: to facilitate synthesis through collaborative projects.  At the same time, each center is unique with respect to its target domain and its strategies and support for CI.  Centers vary in size of staff, budgets, and longevity/experience.  What coordination strategies can be developed to enhance the collective CI capabilities of centers, to raise the overall level of services offered?  Possibilities include (1) explicit sharing of resources, like servers and application deployments, (2) forums for collective discussion and problem solving, (3) meetings and workshops, like this one, to exchange ideas, and (4) cross-center initiatives like grant proposals.  The goal is to capitalize on complementary strengths across centers without placing undue burdens on their staff.
