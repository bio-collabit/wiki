Discussion of CRM software/Communications Coordinators

## Meeting Minutes 
Groups represented: NIMBIOS, iPlant, iDigBio, SESYNC

Need for CRM/Use cases:

* iDigBio
  * Need to manage addresses
  * newsletters, evaluation, listerv are currently seperately manages address sources.
  * There is a need to determine which participant/contact is interested in what news
  * Need to track collaboration 
    * Track communications, who talked to who, track what has been said to which parties

* iPlant
  *Seperate email lists for collaborators, account system (usage of resources should be extracted)
  *Community lists support subscription/unsubscription
  *Outreach is handled via google docs document
  *There is a need to track communication between partner sites, track relationship status with various partners and collaborators

* SESYNC
  * We need to track/manage interested potential participants
  * Track interactions w/ those parties
  * Track analytics for e-mail campaigns
  * currently have account system, group mailing lists, web signup, each project brings its own external contacts

* NIMBios
  * Mailing addresses from applications, evaluation, communications
  *Communications via opt-in list. Have evaluated constant contact for trackign
  *Evaluation curently has its own internal email system
  *Applications are tracked in google docs
  *work underway to merge eval and applications which will be released this summer. new system will also handle group communications

**Cross-Center CRM** 

* Can we track interactions across centers
* ie, when a lead is referred to a sister center, is there followup? what was the outcome?
* iPlant sees 2-3 a week
* Privacy issues will prevent sharing contacts between centers, but can referrals be tracked
  * Can this be task based sharing, per-lead tracking rather than CRM/contact sharing
* Is there a way to identify overlapping contacts and/or ways to play matchmaker between researchers/wg participants at centers?

**Standard CRM Evaluations** 

* SugarCRM, Salesforce tend to have too much focus on completing a sell.
  * The networking aspects of a sale-oriented CRM is interesting for iPlant
    * Followup on researchers who may be interested in new features. (ie, feature requested 6mo-1yr ago, but recently implemented, let all pass individuals who may be interested know)
* Wrike/trello for google docs task tracking 
* **TODO** Sites share evaluations/experience of what CRM software they have used/tested/or are considering
* **TODO** Sites should supply a CRM list of requirements and scope

**Announcement Sharing**

* Can other centers share/rebroadcast announcements?
  *How do you track success of this sharing? Did a researcher attent an iPlant event from an iDigBio rebroadcast? What do the referreal tracking/rates look like?
  * **TODO** Create a list/website for sharing announcements between centers
    *Hows does referrel/clickback tracking work for that site?
    *Can we have a common banner/tagline appended to center announcements directing researchers to the central list/site?
    *Site should track more than just announcements. Include website rss feeds, social media contacts
    * **TODO** Centers should follow each other in social media and share as appropriate
    * **TODO** Everyone should supply their own social contact info to the CollabSCI wiki
    * **TODO** Can we recruit all other nsf/other centers to (ie, nanoinformatics, etc)
